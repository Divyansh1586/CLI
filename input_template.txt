# Line 1: N - Number of nodes in the track
# Example: 4
4

# Line 2: NP - Number of pit stop nodes
# Example: 2
2

# Line 3: C - Number of car configurations
# Example: 2
2

# Line 4: M - Number of directed edges
# Example: 6
6

# Next M lines: Edge definitions (U V DISTANCE)
# Format: source_node destination_node distance
# Example edges:
0 1 10
1 2 15
2 3 12
3 0 8
1 3 20
2 0 18

# Next NP lines: Pit stop node indices
# Example pit nodes:
1
3

# Next C lines: Car configurations (FUEL_CAPACITY TYRE_COST)
# Format: fuel_capacity tyre_cost
# Example car configs:
50 5
75 3

# EXPLANATIONS:
# - Nodes represent track checkpoints/waypoints
# - Edges represent track segments with distances
# - Pit nodes allow refueling and tire changes
# - Fuel capacity: maximum fuel units a car can carry
# - Tyre cost: penalty per unit when exceeding tyre wear limit
# - The algorithm finds optimal paths considering fuel, tyres, and pit stops
